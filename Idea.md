# The Idea

For me, the part that I enjoyed most about Lingo was the discovery of clever connections between words. As such, I enjoyed the themed rooms in LL1 and LL2 the most. This led me to think about how I could make the coolest theme room possible.

Surprisingly, I first thought about the major arcana as a theme before I thought about its connection to Persona. Only when thinking about the title of the map did my mind connect the proper neurons and come up with Personal Project as the title of the map, and Persona as the meta-theme. It was certainly serendipitous that it did though!

Originally, there was going to be no obfuscation on the achievement names. Each section was simply going to have the corresponding arcana as the achievement name, and be directly themed around the corresponding arcana. However, I ran into issues when I was trying to design puzzles for The High Priestess and The Hierophant. Originally, those two were going to be religion themed, but I know and have very little interest in religion, which spurred the idea of obfuscation to create more interesting (for both me as the map creator and you as the player) sub-areas.

## Map Layout

The layout of the map was a very early design decision. I knew that I would have 21 areas, and I wanted to have a hub to avoid endless hallways, so I needed a way to have 21 exits from a central room. These dependencies led to the three-floor octagonal design that is in the map now.

The paintings in each area to warp back to the entry room (the velvet room) were meant to represent the doors to the velvet room found in the Persona games--I think I would do this differently now, where the warps into each area were the doors to the velvet room instead of having separate paintings to exit each room.

## Navy / Velvet

The idea for Navy / Velvet came about serendipitously--it was either `FUSION` in the transparent white tutorial or `EVOCATION` in `THE MAGICIAN` that led me down the rabbit hole to create Navy / Velvet as a mechanic.

Something that never panned out was having navy meta puzzles that would unlock after solving each arcana that would solve to the corresponding Persona characters' persona. There's still remnants of that idea in [#discord-lingo-custom](https://discord.com/channels/906661671144157205/1031312499775131789/1118707102790197278), where I have a puzzle that would have solved to Hermes.

Additionally, I was going to have an area that was solely dedicated to Persona that would have unlocked after solving all 21 arcana, but I wasn't in love with the idea of having to either do enough wiki diving to pull enough good words that I hadn't used in navy puzzles before, reuse words that are in navy puzzles, or make heavy use of proper nouns to manifest that area into reality. I think the meta puzzles that it turned into are a much better finale to the map.

## Multisolve Panels

Multisolve panels came very late in development. I knew pretty early on that 'The World' panel was going to solve to 'The World' to help clue the achievement theme. Luckily enough, Hizami created a script that allowed for multi-solve panels to save to file, which I then adapted to work with achievements, different answer colors, and conditionally opening doors. I'm glad that I put the effort in though, since the 'aha' moment still exists, even for players who got the achievement puzzle theme in either Floor 1 / Floor 2 release.
