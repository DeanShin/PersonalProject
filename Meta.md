# Meta & ARG

## Meta

Originally, there was not going to be any Meta area as the final area. Once you got that the velvet theme was Persona, you'd have one final area to complete that was all Persona-themed answers. I couldn't really do that however given all of the navy blocks already in the map, plus it didn't seem like a good capstone ending to the map, so I decided against it.

### Orange Hell & The Fool



### The Soundtrack

When `MusicArea`s were released, I knew that I wanted ot have custom music for the map. Originally, I was just going to have generic stock music themed for each area, but when choosing music for the velvet room, I thought "wait, why don't I make this the Aria of the Soul?" Of course, I couldn't put the Aria of the Soul in there directly, otherwise I'd spoil the theme of the map to players who knew the song (not to mention copyright), so I, on a whim, decided to flip the melody upside-down. This process repeated for the other three pieces in the map.

At the time, I was working with Indigonao to come up with ideas for the map Chords Only, and I knew that he played the piano, so I asked him if he would be interested in playing the sheet music. He responded yes, so together, we were able to record two pieces together before he got busy.

The next question then was to decide whether to make the music a meta puzzle or not. I chose yes, much to the chagrin of my playtesters. The puzzle itself went through multiple iterations--originally, there were four separate panels for each one of the four songs and no YouTube playlist of candidate songs. This was open to brute-forcing, and it wasn't reasonable to listen to the entire Persona 3 / 4 / 5 soundtrack to recognize which song was being played. I think the way I have it now is the best way that I could have done it to actually have people interface with the music while also being gettable, but I'm interested to see people's reactions to it.

### Butterfly

This puzzle was kinda-sorta planned ever since Floor 1--if I recall correctly, I used `BUTTERFLY` as a clue in areas 4 and 5, realized that it was a funny clue, and then continued doing so when convenient for the rest of the map. It was only during the development of Floor 3 that I realized that it could be a meta-puzzle that went into `PHILEMON`, so I went and retroactively added more `BUTTERFLY` clues throughout the map to make sure that one was in each area. This went well for each area... except for `THE HANGMAN`. I'm pretty sure that none of the words in there work with `BUTTERFLY` as the prompt, so I hid a panel in the corner of the room that says `BUTTERFLY`. Actually, now that I'm typing this, I might go and change one category to be `IF`, `AND`, and `BUT` instead...

## ARG

If you have not solved the ARG, this is a wonderful time to go and solve it!

Okay, last chance.

The ARG was a spur of the moment thing that was inspired by ABGKiwi's ARG from Code 2. The starting idea for the ARG was to have a chain of messages in discord that would solve to some Persona-related thing. I started with Ina (of course), and was as surprised as anyone when there happened to be a cook named Ina Garten who happed to host a show titled 'Be My Guest'.

From there, I thought about the guest puzzle that I had written for Liduongo, and realized that if I found a Stack Overflow page with a Persona-related phrase, then that would be absolutely perfect as the end point for the ARG. Luckily, people suck at grammar, and the next step was to now get a guest puzzle in another map that people could use to get the question ID.

Icely was my immediate candidate--his rate of releasing maps is like no other, and I knew that Ice Anonymous was in the works given the thread, so I DM'ed him on 11/24 if he was releasing the map soon, and if I could put a 'guest' puzzle in for a meta puzzle. Luckily, he agreed.

From that point onwards, the individual clues for each part of the chain were flushed out--I knew that I wanted to take people on a journey through different Lingo-related sites, so the Torah, the Custom Map Guide, and the GitHub were obvious choices. Funnily enough, I think Palidisian found the puzzle in the Torah (it was invisible in 1pt font), and ended up removing it to clean the document, so I only copy pasted into the Torah the day of.

It didn't all go perfectly, however. I DM'ed Chris to ask him to put the BEHIND sign panel behind STACK OVERFLOW, which he agreed to. Two weeks later, and four days before the ARG, I opened Liduongo to double check if it was there and it decidely wasn't. Luckily, Chris was able to get it in the next day. This, compounded with the fact that the release of Ice Anonymous was as nebulous as the release of Lingo 2, (I may or may not have nagged Icely a bit to release Ice Anonymous, sorry!) made for a couple of stressful days before release.
