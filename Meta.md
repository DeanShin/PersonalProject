## ARG

If you have not solved the ARG, this is a wonderful time to go and solve it!

Okay, last chance.

The ARG was a spur of the moment thing that was inspired by ABGKiwi's ARG from Code 2. The starting idea for the ARG was to have a chain of messages in discord that would solve to some Persona-related thing. I started with Ina (of course), and was as surprised as anyone when there happened to be a cook named Ina Garten who happed to host a show titled 'Be My Guest'.

From there, I thought about the guest puzzle that I had written for Liduongo, and realized that if I found a Stack Overflow page with a Persona-related phrase, then that would be absolutely perfect as the end point for the ARG. Luckily, people suck at grammar, and the next step was to now get a guest puzzle in another map that people could use to get the question ID.

Icely was my immediate candidate--his rate of releasing maps is like no other, and I knew that Ice Anonymous was in the works given the thread, so I DM'ed him on 11/24 if he was releasing the map soon, and if I could put a 'guest' puzzle in for a meta puzzle. Luckily, he agreed.

From that point onwards, the individual clues for each part of the chain were flushed out--I knew that I wanted to take people on a journey through different Lingo-related sites, so the Torah, the Custom Map Guide, and the GitHub were obvious choices. Funnily enough, I think Palidisian found the puzzle in the Torah (it was invisible in 1pt font), and ended up removing it to clean the document, so I only copy pasted into the Torah the day of.

It didn't all go perfectly, however. I DM'ed Chris to ask him to put the BEHIND sign panel behind STACK OVERFLOW, which he agreed to. Two weeks later, and four days before the ARG, I opened Liduongo to double check if it was there and it decidely wasn't. Luckily, Chris was able to get it in the next day. This, compounded with the fact that the release of Ice Anonymous was as nebulous as the release of Lingo 2, (I may or may not have nagged Icely a bit to release Ice Anonymous, sorry!) made for a couple of stressful days before release.
