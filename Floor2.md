# Floor 2

## Transparent Blue

Transparent Blue (and Transparent Red by extension) was inspired by Pastel Cyan in Tofu--originally, the middle height would have been affixes instead of word roots, but there's not a lot of those in English, and word roots are more versatile. I was also planning on using transparent blue checkered with navy to clue AGI / BUFU / ZIO etc. in a navy-only area, but I figured that people would have had enough wiki hunting with all of the other navies.

## Transparent Red

Transparent Red and more specifically, transparent red checkered black came about from a need to make transparent blue usable in more than the transparent blue tutorial room. Overall, I'm relatively happy with how transparent red and transparent blue turned out, but I don't really think that they make for the best puzzles, since word root / prefix / suffix knowledge isn't really common knowledge nor is it the most searchable.

## Justice / Ice

Just ice. This area was inspired by The Lovers' red-blue chain mechanic, which made me think "How can I have another room with absurdly long chains"? I started off with different types of chains all starting from the word 'ICE', but then narrowed my scope to only include blue checkered yellow. If I remember right, the idea to make the answer for all of the chains "ice" came about from the ICE -> RICE -> RELIC -> ECLAIR -> GLACIER -> ICE chain.

## The Hermit / The Hikikomori

Ahh yes, my favorite area. I remember that I was struggling to figure out what The Hermit area could be, when I looked for synonyms of 'hermit' online and saw 'Hikikomori'. Given my profile picture, and my recent playtest of the map 'Tofu', the option to make the area Hololive was too tempting to pass up.

The next challenge after that however was how to make interesting puzzles for the section. **Proper nouns are not fun to type in**, so I needed some way to circumvent that requirement for the area to be enjoyable, which inspired the adjective-noun structure of the area. Coming up with those adjectives and nouns was also a large task--most of the VTubers had canonical nouns that I could use (e.g. Ina is a Priestess of the Ancient Ones), and others I had to more digging for (I haven't really watched Gen 0). I also collaborated with Arisu to come up with some of the adjective-noun pairs, so massive thanks to them.

Funnily enough, as I was developing the area, Hololive EN Advent was announced and debuted, so I *had* to create an entirely new floor to fit them in. I'm also really happy with the puzzles in the area--they all are pretty fair, and there's a lot of fun ones in there (A-DOOR-ABLE is classic), even though I didn't create a new mechanic for the area.

## 9.5 / Hololive Heaven

I'm not sorry. Blame Tofu.

## The Wheel of Fortune / The Slot Machine

## Strength / Power

## The Hanged Man / The Hangman

Boy am I glad that there was such an obvious mechanic for this tarot card. I think this was many people's favorite from Floor 2, and it's easy to see why. Coming up with the categories was harder than you might expect--it's not easy to come up with 10 different commonly known pairs / trios / quartets of words.

## Death / Execution

My major in college is Computer Science, so making an area about programming was a given. The idea behind this area was to make very messy wall of panels, and to have the player parse what was actually going on, but I don't think that that ended up being as much of an issue for people as I thought. The `INTERMEDIATE`` grays were stolen from Tofu to make the double wides easier, but in hindsight, a lot of them can probably be removed.

## Temperance / Virtue

My least favorite area in Floor 2. This was the last area that I made for Floor 2, and at this point, I was kind of rushing to get it out. I had just taken a Philosophy class, and remembered Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, found a complete list of them online, and somehow had to clue them. That spawned the cream checkered red mechanic. I think the main issue with this area is twofold--for one, the obscure words mean that it's not possible to get some of the cream words, even if you have all of the component words. The lack of consistency between cream checkered reds (sometimes it removes 0 letters in a component word, sometimes it removes a ton) compounds this issue.

I also ended up removing two rows of ethics, as they had words that were even more arcane, which is why there are some empty rows in the church.
