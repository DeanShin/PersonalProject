## Transparent Blue

Transparent Blue (and Transparent Red by extension) was inspired by Pastel Cyan in Tofu--originally, the middle height would have been affixes instead of word roots, but there's not a lot of those in English, and word roots are more versatile. I was also planning on using transparent blue checkered with navy to clue AGI / BUFU / ZIO etc. in a navy-only area, but I figured that people would have had enough wiki hunting with all of the other navies.

## Transparent Red

Transparent Red and more specifically, transparent red checkered black came about from a need to make transparent blue usable in more than the transparent blue tutorial room. Overall, I'm relatively happy with how transparent red and transparent blue turned out, but I don't really think that they make for the best puzzles, since word root / prefix / suffix knowledge isn't really common knowledge nor is it the most searchable.

## Justice

Just ice. This area was inspired by The Lovers' red-blue chain mechanic, which made me think "How can I have another room with absurdly long chains"? If I remember right, the idea to make the answer for all of the chains "ice" came about from the ICE -> RICE -> RELIC -> ECLAIR -> GLACIER -> ICE chain.

## The Hermit

Ahh yes, my favorite area. I remember that I was struggling to figure out what The Hermit area could be, when I looked for synonyms of 'hermit' online and saw 'Hikikomori'. Given my profile picture, and my recent playtest of the map 'Tofu', the option to make the area Hololive was too tempting to pass up. The next challenge after that however was how to make interesting puzzles for the section. **Proper nouns are not fun to type in**, so I needed some way to circumvent that requirement for the area to be enjoyable, which inspired the adjective-noun structure of the area. Coming up with those adjectives and nouns was also a large task--most of the VTubers had canonical nouns that I could use (e.g. Ina is a Priestess of the Ancient Ones), and others I had to more digging for (I haven't really watched Gen 0). I also collaborated with Arisu to come up with some of the adjective-noun pairs, so massive thanks to them. Funnily enough, as I was developing the area, Hololive EN Advent was announced and debuted, so I *had* to create an entirely new floor to fit them in. I'm also really happy with the puzzles in the area--they all are pretty fair, and there's a lot of fun ones in there (A-DOOR-ABLE is classic), even though I didn't create a new mechanic for the area.
