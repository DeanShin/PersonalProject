## Transparent Brown

OGs will remember that transparent brown used to be called copper, and that the transparent block was just a placeholder while I tried to figure out how to add custom mesh instances into the map. Interestingly, the transparent brown mechanic came before the transparent white mechanic. As mentioned in [The Idea](Idea.md), I was originally going to have a list of protagonist persona as puzzles in the map, so I needed a mechanic that could clue those names. As most of them are mythological beings, and mythological beings are most famous for their unfortunate demises, a "killed by" mechanic was the natural next step. Unfortunately, said mechanic didn't translate into the top and middle heights at all, which necessitated the new height system of BEGINNING, MIDDLE, and END.

## Transparent White

Transparent white was created to serve as a simpler introduction to the new height system than transparent brown. I remember that I was playtesting the custom map [Tofu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3003696018) at the time, which has a _very_ similar mechanic (dark pastel), so there may or may not have been some cross-pollination occurring at the time.

## The Magician / The Wizard

This was the first area that I designed for the map, and I think it really shows. While I love the concept behind it (the two overarching themes that re-contextualize the sub-themes), the amount of proper nouns is very much unideal.

## The High Priestess / The High

Ah yes, the funny drug area. This was the area where I realized "wait, I don't really want to make puzzles themed around various religions" and embraced my inner troll. There are definitely some good puzzles here (water), but also some absolutely horrid ones (I'm looking at you ayahuasca).

## The Empress / The 'M'pressive

The idea for the "M"pressive came about because I needed a way to disambiguate The Empress and The Emperor from one another. I'm really happy about how this area turned out puzzle wise (except maybe MISOLOGY), but if I were to remake it, I would definitely make the environment more open so that you aren't banging your shoulders on the walls.

## The Emperor / The King

This area was designed around the middle "noble titles" theme--the idea was that you're ascending the steps to the throne, and as you climb higher, the societal ranking increases. The wars were also sorted, with the earliest war on the bottom step, and the most recent one on the top step. I wish I could have come up with a way to organize the forms of government, but I couldn't think of anything at the time. I also remember that I tried to overlap a glass gridmap with the regular gridmap at this point to get a smoother gradient for the "bricks" on the wall, but some crazy Z-clipping prevented those plans.

## The Hierophant / The Font

I really love the typography theme in this room--I was really happy with how you'd see all these normal words that just so happen to be typographical terms. What I'm a bit sad about was the font styles section--The idea was that the gray blocks would denote which keyboard command you'd use to use the corresponding font style, but different operating systems, not to mention different text editors have different keyboard commands to do so, making the puzzles not work as well.

## The Lovers / The Intertwined

Probably my and many others' favorite area in the first floor. I think this was the only area (besides The Sun) where I came up with the mechanic first before thinking about how it would tie into the 'Lovers' theme. I was extremely surprised that no-one had done this idea before, and I'm glad that people enjoyed it as much as they did. The idea of the white and black chains denoting the same / opposite words came while I was laying out all of the blocks. Before, I just happened to come up with chains that ended on opposite words, but the environmental cluing in my opinion added another layer to the puzzle.

## The Chariot / The Vehicle

Making chains is really fun. I think the majority of the chains in this room ended up being very reasonable (especially given the side panels) with the exception of GLACIAL EROSION -> FJORD -> FORD and CONTENTMENT -> COMPLACENCY -> PLACE. The gray block that solved to CHAINS surprisingly didn't come first--it was only after I created a couple chains that I realized the opportunity.
