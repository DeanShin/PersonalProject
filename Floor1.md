## Transparent Brown
OGs will remember that transparent brown used to be called copper, and that the transparent block was just a placeholder while I tried to figure out how to add custom mesh instances into the map. Interestingly, the transparent brown mechanic came before the transparent white mechanic. As mentioned in [The Idea](Idea.md), I was originally going to have a list of protagonist persona as puzzles in the map, so I needed a mechanic that could clue those names. As most of them are mythological beings, and mythological beings are most famous for their unfortunate demises, a "killed by" mechanic was the natural next step. Unfortunately, said mechanic didn't translate into the top and middle heights at all, which necessitated the new height system of BEGINNING, MIDDLE, and END. 

## Transparent White
Transparent white was created to serve as a simpler introduction to the new height system than transparent brown. I remember that I was playtesting the custom map [Tofu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3003696018) at the time, which has a _very_ similar mechanic, so there may or may not have been some cross-pollination occurring at the time.

## The Magician
This was the first area that I designed for the map, and I think it really shows. While I love the concept behind it (the two overarching themes that re-contextualize the sub-themes), the amount of proper nouns is very much unideal. 

## The High Priestess
Ah yes, the funny drug area. This was the area where I realized "wait, I don't really want to make puzzles themed around various religions" and embraced my inner troll. There are definitely some good puzzles here (water), but also some absolutely horrid ones (I'm looking at you ayahuasca).

## The Empress
The idea for the "M"pressive came about because I needed a way to disambiguate The Empress and The Emperor from one another. I'm really happy about how this area turned out puzzle wise (except maybe MISOLOGY), but if I were to remake it, I would definitely make the environment more open so that you aren't banging your shoulders on the walls. 

## The Emperor
This area was designed around the middle "noble titles" theme--the idea was that you're ascending the steps to the throne, and as you climb higher, the societal ranking increases. The wars were also sorted, with the earliest war on the bottom step, and the most recent one on the top step. I wish I could have come up with a way to organize the forms of government, but I couldn't think of anything at the time. I also remember that I tried to overlap a glass gridmap with the regular gridmap at this point to get a smoother gradient for the "bricks" on the wall, but some crazy Z-clipping prevented those plans.
